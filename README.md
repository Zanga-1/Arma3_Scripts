Hello,

just sharing some scripts i made/modified to use in a personal mission, feel free to contact via Discord -> "zanga."
Really new into Arma 3 SQF so they could be better, if you end up improving it please share it so i can update and use them too :)

Amb_Firefights - Generates client-side vanilla firefight sounds;

Amb_Helis - Generate random duo helicopters passing within the player view range in random directions;

ObjGen_Craters - Generate craters all over the map destroying objects within set radius from them;

ObjGen_DmgTrashWrecks - Generate Trash and wrecks within set distance from roads, also spawn heli wrecks in all helipads from the map;

Sys_GearRPG_Loot - Script to replace bodies with crates which get filled by the killed unit if they meet the "loot chance";
